# Train-Scheduler

## Description

Train-Scheduler is an app that provides up-to-date information about trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.  A user can enter a train in the form then click the submit button.  The app will then store the information on a database in Firebase, then calculate when the next train will arrive relative to the current time.
